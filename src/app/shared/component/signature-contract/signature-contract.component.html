        <h2>HM CARGO LLC ROLE AND CARRIER'S LIABILITY</h2>
      </div>
      <div>
        Thank you for making HM CARGO LLC your top choice for your shipping needs. We appreciate your business and strive to provide premium quality service at all times. Please note, however, that while every effort is made to ensure safe delivery of your goods, sometimes loss and/damage may occur.
      </div>
      <div>
        By law, HM CARGO LLC arranges for the transportation of your goods, however it is the carrier who bears the responsibility for any loss/damage to your freight. The carrier’s liability for freight moving over the ocean is governed by the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA). Under the terms of COGSA, the most you could recover from shipping lines in the event they are proven negligent is $500 for each Customary Freight Unit (CFU). Measurement of the CFU is widely defined, and can vary from one container to one pallet.
      </div>
      <div>
        COGSA is centered on the liability of the carrier. The concept of the carrier liability assumes that the carrier is not responsible for paying claims if they did not cause or contribute to the loss. In the event that HM CARGO LLC acts as an NVOCC and assumes carrier liability, recovery in the event of a claim is still limited by COGSA in the bill of lading terms and conditions.
      </div>
      <div>
        In order to better define carrier liability, Hague-Visby rules were created to define 17 circumstances under which the carrier cannot be held liable. If a loss is caused by any one of the following defenses; the ocean carrier will not pay for any part of the loss:
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li> Any neglect default of error of the carrier in navigation or of management of the ship</li>
        <li> Perils or dangers of the sea (storms etc.)</li>
        <li> Inherent defect, quality or vice of the goods</li>
        <li> Fire</li>
        <li> Quarantine restrictions</li>
        <li> Acts or omissions of the shipper</li>
        <li> Strikes, lockouts or labor shortage</li>
        <li> Riots or civil commotions</li>
        <li> Act of God</li>
        <li> Act of war or public enemies</li>
        <li> Insufficient packing</li>
        <li> Arrest, restraint or seizure</li>
        <li> Defects not discoverable by due diligence</li>
        <li> Attempting to save life or property at sea</li>
      </ul>
      <div>
        Please note: This summary is provided only for informational purposes. It does not grant or extend coverage.
